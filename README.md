Diagnosis of Unilateral Facial Paralysis using Machine Learning

Facial paralysis is a medical condition characterized by the loss of voluntary muscle movement in the face. It can result from various causes, including trauma, infection, or neurological 
disorders. Accurate and timely diagnosis of facial paralysis is crucial for effective treatment and management. In this research paper, we propose a novel approach for the identification of 
facial paralysis using the Mediapipe model. Our method focuses on differentiating normal faces from paralyzed faces based on the ratio of areas ofspecific facial regions. A dataset consisting 
of 111 smiling normal faces and 104 unilateral paralyzed faces was studied to develop the classification model. This paper presents six innovative indices designed to evaluate asymmetry 
and changes in specific facial features, encompassing the visibility of teeth area, depth of the nasolabial fold, left and right commissure ratios, smile index ratio, visible area of teeth,
and visible area of eyes.
